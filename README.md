# HSE RFCs

This repo tracks RFCs (request for comment) for all project under the
[`hse-project`](https://github.com/hse-project).

## Purpose

Although HSE uses issues and pull requests to implement and coordinate
development, some changes require more thorough consideration with an
opportunity for various stake holders to provide input on how the proposed
changes affect them. The RFC (request for comments) process intends to provide
a consistent and controlled way of developing HSE for the benefit of all.

## When to use an RFC

When determining whether you should submit an RFC, use the following criteria:

- Any backwards-incompatible change including breaks of either the API or the
  ABI
- Additions to the API
- Major or significant internal change
- Changes to the RFC process

The following cases most likely do not require an RFC:

- Changes that are likely to only be visible to HSE developers themselves,
  not user-facing
- Minor reorganization or refactoring of code
- Additions that would reduce and strictly improve numerical criteria like
  warnings, speed optimization, binary sizes, etc.

## Before Submitting an RFC

We value the opinion of all those willing to contribute to HSE and our major
stakeholders. In order to make sure your RFC has the largest chance of being
accepted, it is important to take your time. Evaluate whether the topic of your
RFC has been proposed before and been previously rejected. It is also important
to solicit maintainer feedback early on in your ideation process. Open a
[discussion](https://github.com/hse-project/hse/discussions) on the main
[HSE repository](https://github.com/hse-project/hse) about your idea, and
maintainers can give their opinion on whether or not your RFC is worth pursuing.

## RFC Process

In order to submit an RFC, please follow the following guidelines:
