/*! @mainpage Overview
 *
 * The HSE library is generally described in other places. The documentation here is
 * geared towards describing the structure of the HSE API and the specifics of each
 * entry point's operation.
 *
 * Terminology:
 *
 *     KVS               - Key-value store, containing zero or more key-value (KV)
 *                         pairs
 *
 *     KVDB              - Key-value database, comprised of one or more KVSs and
 *                         defining a transaction domain
 *
 *     key               - A byte string used to uniquely identify values for
 *                         storage, retrieval, and deletion in a KVS
 *
 *     multi-segment key - A key that is logically divided into N segments (N >= 2),
 *                         arranged to group related KV pairs when keys are sorted
 *                         lexicographically
 *
 *     key prefix        - For multi-segment keys, the first K segments (1 <= K < N)
 *                         that group related KV pairs when keys are sorted lexi-
 *                         cographically
 *
 *     key prefix length - For multi-segment keys, the length of a key prefix (bytes)
 *
 *     unsegmented key   - A key that is not logically divided into segments

 * These types are generally opaque handles that a client obtains by using library

/** @name Transaction Functions
 *        =====================================================

/*
 * The HSE KVDB provides transactions with operations spanning KVSs within a single
 * KVDB.  These transactions have snapshot isolation (a specific form of MVCC) with the
 * normal semantics (see "Concurrency Control and Recovery in Database Systems" by PA
 * Bernstein).
 *
 * One unusual aspect of the API as it relates to transactions is that the data object
 * that is used to hold client-level transaction state is allocated separately from the
 * transaction being initiated. As a result, the same object handle should be reused
 * again and again.
 *
 * In addition, there is very limited coupling between threading and transactions. A
 * single thread may have many transactions in flight simultaneously. Also operations
 * within a transaction can be performed by multiple threads. The latter mode of
 * operation must currently restrict calls so that only one thread is actively
 * performing an operation in the context of a particular transaction at any particular
 * time.
 *
 * The general lifecycle of a transaction is as follows:
 *
 *                       +----------+
 *                       | INVALID  |
 *                       +----------+
 *                             |
 *                             v
 *                       +----------+
 *     +---------------->|  ACTIVE  |<----------------+
 *     |                 +----------+                 |
 *     |  +-----------+    |      |     +----------+  |
 *     +--| COMMITTED |<---+      +---->| ABORTED  |--+
 *        +-----------+                 +----------+
 *
 * When a transaction is initially allocated, it starts in the INVALID state. When
 * hse_kvdb_txn_begin() is called with transaction in the INVALID, COMMITTED, or ABORTED
 * states, it moves to the ACTIVE state. It is an error to call the hse_kvdb_txn_begin()
 * function on a transaction in the ACTIVE state. For a transaction in the ACTIVE state,
 * only the functions hse_kvdb_txn_commit(), hse_kvdb_txn_abort(), or
 * hse_kvdb_txn_free() may be called (with the last doing an abort prior to the free).
 *
 * When a transaction becomes ACTIVE, it establishes an ephemeral snapshot view of the
 * state of the KVDB. Any data mutations outside of the transaction's context after that
 * point are not visible to the transaction. Similarly, any mutations performed within
 * the context of the transaction are not visible outside of the transaction unless and
 * until it is committed. All such mutations become visible atomically.

 *
 * When cursors are created they are by default forward iterating. If the caller of
 * hse_kvs_cursor_create() passes a reference to an initialized opspec with bit flag
 * HSE_KVDB_KOP_FLAG_REVERSE set, then a backwards (reverse sort order) iterating cursor
 * is created. A cursor's direction is determined when it is created and is immutable.
 *
 * Cursors are of one of three types: (1) free, (2) transaction snapshot, and (3)
 * transaction bound. A cursor of type (1) is based on an ephemeral snapshot view of the
 * KVS at the time it is created. New data is not visible to the cursor until
 * hse_kvs_cursor_update() is called on it. A cursor of type (2) takes on the
 * transaction's ephemeral snapshot but cannot see any of the mutations made by its
 * associated transaction. A cursor of type (3) is like type (2) but it always can see
 * the mutations made by the transaction. Calling hse_kvs_cursor_update() on a cursor of
 * types (2) and (3) without changing the hse_kvdb_opspec fields is a no-op. This
 * function is thread safe.
 *
 * The hse_kvdb_opspec referent shapes the type and behavior of the cursor created. The
 * flag fields within kop_flags are independent. Passing a NULL for the opspec is the
 * same as passing an initialized but otherwise unmodified opspec.
 *
 *   - To create a cursor of type (1):
 *       - Pass either a NULL for opspec, or
 *       - Pass an initialized opspec with kop_txn == NULL
 *
 *   - To create a cursor of type (2):
 *       - Pass an initialized opspec with kop_txn == <target txn>
 *
 *   - To create a cursor of type (3):
 *       - Pass an initialized opspec with kop_txn == <target txn> and
 *         a kop_flags value with position HSE_KVDB_KOP_FLAG_BIND_TXN set
 *
 * The primary utility of the prefix filter mechanism is to maximize the efficiency of
 * cursor iteration on a KVS with multi-segment keys. For that use case, the caller
 * should supply a filter whose length is greater than or equal to the KVS key prefix
 * length. The caller can also provide a filter that is shorter than the key prefix
 * length or can perform this operation on a KVS whose key prefix length is zero. In all
 * cases, the cursor will be restricted to keys matching the given prefix filter.
 *
 * When a transaction associated with a cursor of type (3) commits or aborts, the state
 * of the cursor becomes unbound, i.e., it becomes of type (1). What can be seen through
 * the cursor depends on whether it was created with the HSE_KVDB_KOP_FLAG_STATIC_VIEW
 * flag set.
 *
 * If it was set, then the cursor retains the snapshot view of the transaction (for both
 * commit and abort). If it was not set then the view of the cursor is that of the
 * database at the time of the commit or abort. In the commit case, the cursor can see
 * the mutations of the transaction, if any. Note that this will make any other
 * mutations that occurred during the lifespan of the transaction visible as well.
